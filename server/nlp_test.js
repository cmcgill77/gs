//NOTE getting error at runtime when trying to import, looks like will need to wait for meteor node 6 support

//import spacyNLP from 'spacy-nlp'

//const spacyNLP = require('spacy-nlp')
// default port 6466
// start the server with the python client that exposes spacyIO (or use an existing socketIO server at IOPORT)
//var serverPromise = spacyNLP.server({ port: process.env.IOPORT })
// Loading spacy may take up to 15s
